# Background

MSIX supports the ability for packaged applications to access components and other files distributed as Framework packages. However this functionality provides a rather 'static' world view, where dependencies are known at development time and resolved at install-time. There is no support for runtime to define a Framework dependency based on machine state, user interface or other post-development factors. Access to Framework package content is also limited access to packaged applications; non-packaged applications cannot use content provided via Framework packages.

Microsoft-internal task [23447728](https://task.ms/23447728)

This is the spec for proposal [MSIX Dynamic Dependencies - allow any process to use MSIX Framework packages #89](https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/89).

# Description

This feature providse APIs to enable access to packaged content at runtime, regardless if the caller is packaged or not. This supplements the MSIX appmodel's current static dependency support (via in appxmanifest.xml) with a dynamic runtime equivalent. It also allows non-packaged processes (which have no appxmanifest.xml) to use packaged content.

# Examples

Samples illustrating the DynamicDependency APIs
* [Sample 1](sample-1.md) - Fabrikam app using Contosso's Muffins package [\[Win32\]](sample-1.md#win32) [\[WinRT\]](sample-1.md#winrt)
* [Sample 2](sample-2.md) - Fabrikam app using Contosso's Muffins package with smart class helpers [\[Win32\]](sample-2.md#win32)
* [Sample 3](sample-3.md) - LolzKitten app using Contosso's Muffins package via transient package dependency [\[Win32\]](sample-3.md#win32) [\[WinRT\]](sample-3.md#winrt)
* [Sample 4](sample-4.md) - LolzKitten Installer / Uninstaller with File+Registry LifetimeArtifacts [\[Win32\]](sample-4.md#win32) [\[WinRT\]](sample-4.md#winrt)
* [Sample 5](sample-5.md) - LolzKitten app using PackageDependency pinned by LolzKitten Installer [\[Win32\]](sample-5.md#win32) [\[WinRT\]](sample-5.md#winrt)
* [Sample 6](sample-6.md) - LolzKitten Installer / Uninstaller defining a 32bit PackageDependency [\[Win32\]](sample-6.md#win32) [\[WinRT\]](sample-6.md#winrt)
* [Sample 7](sample-7.md) - LolzKitten app ordering Packages in PackageGraph [\[Win32\]](sample-7.md#win32) [\[WinRT\]](sample-7.md#winrt)
* [Sample 8](sample-8.md) - LolzKitten app ordering Packages in PackageGraph with prepend [\[Win32\]](sample-8.md#win32) [\[WinRT\]](sample-8.md#winrt)

# Remarks

All processes have a package graph. A process may be created with entries in its package graph; this is referred to as the 'static package graph'.

Packaged processes (i.e. a process with package identity) are created with a static package graph per their AppxManifest.xml. A process' static package graph cannot be altered, but it can be supplemented at runtime via the Dynamic Dependency API.

Processes without package identity have an no static package graph. They can modify their package graph using the Dynamic Dependency API.

```MddPinPackageDependency``` defines a package dependency.

```MddAddPackageDependency``` determines a package that satisfies a package dependency and updates the caller's process. This includes adding the resolved package to the process' package graph, updating the Loader to include the resolved package in the DLL Search Order, etc. The package dependency is resolved to a specific package if not already resolved.

A resolved PackageDependency is represented by ```MDD_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCY_CONTEXT```.

Once a PackageDependency is resolved to a package all further ```MddAddPackageDependency``` calls yield the same result until the package dependency is unresolved. Resolved package dependencies are tracked by User + PackageDependencyId. This ensures multiple overlapping calls to ```MddAddPackageDependency``` yield the same result. A package dependency is unresolved when the last ```MDD_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCY_CONTEXT``` is closed (via ```MddRemovePackageDependency``` or process termination).

```MddRemovePackageDependency``` removes the resolved PackageDependency from the calling process' package graph.

```MddUnpinPackageDependency``` undefines a package dependency previously defined via ```MddPinPackageDependency```.

PackageDependency definitions and usage are tracked and managed on a per-user basis.

PackageDependency definitions are not persisted or tracked across reboots if ```MddPinPackageDependency``` is called with ```MddMddPinPackageDependency::LifecycleHint_Process```. Specify ```MddPinPackageDependency::LifecycleHint_FileOrPath``` or ```MddPinPackageDependency::LifecycleHint_RegistrySubkey``` for ```MddPinPackageDependency``` to persist the definition until explicitly removed via ```MddUnpinPackageDependency``` or the specified lifetime artifact is deleted.

If concurrent processes need the same package resolution for a defined criteria they should share the packageDependencyId returned by ```MddPinPackageDependency```. Concurrent processes running as the same user calling ```MddAddPackageDependency``` with the same packageDependencyId get the same resolved package added to their package graph. This enables multiple concurrent processes needing the same package resolution get a consistent answer.

Package dependencies can only be resolved to packages registered for a user. As packages cannot be registered for LocalSystem the Dynamic Dependencies feature is not available to callers running as LocalSystem.

# API Notes

<!-- TEMPLATE

    Option 1: Give a one or two line description of each API (type and member),
        or at least the ones that aren't obvious from their name. These
        descriptions are what show up in IntelliSense. For properties, specify
        the default value of the property if it isn't the type's default (for
        example an int-typed property that doesn't default to zero.)

    Option 2: Put these descriptions in the below API Details section,
        with a "///" comment above the member or type.

Q: Package dependencies are only resolved for Framework packages. Should other package types (Main, Resource, Optional) be supported?

Q:WinRT: How should 'lifetimeArtifact' and MddPinPackageDependency_LifecycleHint* be expressed in the WinRT API? Some ideas:
* String file; String regkey; if both null then it's Process
* String lifetimeArtifact; boolean isFile; boolean isReg; boolean isProcess; and only 1 can be true
* ILifetimeArtifact property with multiple implementations e.g. FileLifetimeArtifact = { string file; } vs * RegistryLifetimeArtifact = { HKEY root; string subkey; } vs Process=null
* ?

Q:WinRT: How to express equivalent of PACKAGE_DEPENDENCY_RANK_DEFAULT?
